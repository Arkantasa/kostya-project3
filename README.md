## General

After a lot of sweat and tears, endless googling and research I managed to transform the static memory game into an interactive one. Basically rewrote this code a billion times until I had to go back to the "roots" of the code and take the basic layout which Udacity gave us. I'd really like to thank random people on the web who helped me figure things out as well. I'll keep on trying my best and trying to become a front end web developer.

## Contributing

This is basically the starter code + the code i've written. Am definitely not going to accept any pull requests lol.
